Arkwaifu is a website which, arranges and provides almost all artworks extracted from Arknights (the game). Arkwaifu
also enlarges (4x) the artworks with super-resolution neural networks - Real-ESRGAN.

üéâ Arkwaifu v1 has released! Check it at [arkwaifu.cc](https://arkwaifu.cc/)!

üá®üá≥ The China mirror has been suspended due to the v0 ‚Üí v1 upgrade. We will make our best efforts to get it back soon.

For more information of the frontend of Arkwaifu, please refer to
the [frontend repo](https://github.com/FlandiaYingman/arkwaifu-frontend).

## Features

- The arts are automatically updated as soon as the game updates.
- Assets are enlarged with super-resolution neural networks (Real-ESRGAN).

## Available Arts

Now, only arts that appear in the "in-game stories", are available, including **images**, **backgrounds** and *
*characters**.

### Images

Images are the exquisite artworks that appear when some special events in the stories happen.
