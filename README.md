Arkwaifu is a website which, arranges and provides almost all picture assets extracted from Arknights (the game).

Arkwaifu also enlarges (4x) the picture assets with super-resolution neural
networks, [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN)
and [Real-CUGAN](https://github.com/bilibili/ailab/tree/main/Real-CUGAN).

Currently, only assets, that appear in the "in-game stories" (what we call: AVG), are available, including:

- "Images". They are the exquisite arts that appear when some special events happened.
- "Backgrounds". They are the backgrounds that always appear on the bottom layer, during dialogue.
- "Characters". They are the pictures of characters that act in the play, some of them are with different emotions.

I also plan to include the artwork of characters in-game.
However, by considering some technical difficulties, especially there are some animated artworks, the plan is delayed.

This project is now available online!

# Features

- Assets are kept up-to-date automatically whenever the game is updated.
- Assets are enlarged with super-resolution neural networks ([Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN)
  , [Real-CUGAN](https://github.com/bilibili/ailab/tree/main/Real-CUGAN)).
- Assets are classified into handy categories (AVG, non-AVG; main stories, activities; etc.).
- Containerized backend (microservices) and frontend.
- The backend follows microservice architecture and is split into two services: 'service', which serves the data, and
  'updateloop' which updates the data automatically.

# V1 Roadmap #

- [x] I18N üåè! Add Chinese support.
- [x] Extract gamedata directly from the game resources.
- [x] Create API to manually update the resources.
- [x] Support enlarging picture assets with neural networks.
- [x] Redesign & Rewrite the controller interface.
- [ ] Redesign the frontend UX.

Thanks to my friend [Galvin Gao](https://github.com/GalvinGao)!
He helped me a lot in the front-end development and choosing frameworks. I really appreciate the "getting hands dirty"
methodology very much.

Thanks to my friend [Martin Wang](https://github.com/martinwang2002)!
He helped me in extracting the gamedata assets, and also in some details of automatically updating the assets from the
game.

Thanks to my friend Lily! She drew the fascinating [Phantom logo](assets/arkwaifu_phantom.png) of this project.

Thanks to [Penguin Statistics](https://penguin-stats.io/)!
The prototype of this project referenced and is inspired by Penguin
Statistics' [backend v3](https://github.com/penguin-statistics/backend-next).

Thanks to [xinntao](https://github.com/xinntao), [nihui](https://github.com/nihui), and the other contributors
of [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN)
and [Real-CUGAN](https://github.com/bilibili/ailab/tree/main/Real-CUGAN)! They created the neural networks this project
utilizes for enlarging assets.
