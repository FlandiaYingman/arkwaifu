## V0

Features / Fixes: 

- [x] Design the home page and the about page.
- [x] Remove the previous group and the next group in story page. Add them back in the future.
- [x] Change the title in app bar whenever page changes.
- [x] Add subtitle to each category in the navigation drawer to explain them. 

Improvements: 

- [ ] The first load takes too long time - probably because of the CDN (jsdelivr.net).
